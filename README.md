# Image-processing-with-Artificial-Intelligence-coin-identifier-and-counter

In this project we will discuss the use of machine learning for the solution of a coin identification and counting problem through images.

This project is thinking about a problem that occurs in the enterprises of Icesi's university students. 

Different machine learning techniques will be used, in which the use of HoughCircle for the identification of circles, the application of a viable solution on this problem of classificatory type, specifically multi-label, stand out.
